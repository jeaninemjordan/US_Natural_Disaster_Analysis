# US_Natural_Disaster_Analysis
 
## Final Project Deliverable 1 - Due November 3rd

* Sourced data from Kaggle [FEMA US Natural Disasters 1953 - 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/us-natural-disaster-declarations?resource=download)
* Decided with team this would be a great source to work with, lots of data to glean from and make model predictions.
* Discussed with team how to clean data and what fields to drop, what information was relevant for our overall goal.
